Out of the total 10,102 applicants, only 3785 were female. Furthermore, only 177 females, compared to 626 males, applied for executive level positions. In the following exercises, you'll use your new coding skills to summarize this data with some statistics."

In 2016, the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) found that women held only 25% of all positions in computing, and this number has been declining since reaching its peak of 36% in 1991. Though these numbers may seem discouraging, there have never been more resources dedicated to closing the gender gap in tech. Your participation in the Data Science Summer Experience is a great first step to prepare you for being a future leader in the tech industry!"
