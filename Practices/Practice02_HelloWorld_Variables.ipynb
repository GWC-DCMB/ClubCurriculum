In 2016, the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) found that women held only 25% of all positions in computing, and this number has been declining since reaching its peak of 36% in 1991. Though these numbers may seem discouraging, there have never been more resources dedicated to closing the gender gap in tech. Your participation in the GWC Data Science Summer Experience is a great first step towards becoming a future leader in the tech industry!"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"rJ2jNg0dF2Ey","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
