## What is live coding?

Live coding is when instructors work through the lesson explaining and typing in the code as they go, and learners code along on their own computers.

This is is an _interactive approach_ to teach coding where learners can practice and get feedback on what they are learning in _real time_ (did the code work?). This is called a practice-feedback model.

## Why live coding?

Advantages:
- Easier for learners to follow along
- Instructors can be more responsive to 'what if?' questions
- Can learn by watching how instructors do things
- Slows instructor down
- Learners get to see instructors make mistakes and diagnose and correct them

Challenges:
- Requires instructors to be able to improvise when things go wrong or when learners have questions not directly addressed in the text of the lesson
- Can be hard for learners to listen and type at the same time
- May take practice for instructors to get used to thinking aloud while coding in front of an audience

## Importance of a growth mindset

Two ways of thinking about your abilities:

- **Fixed mindset:** your abilities are innate and unchangeable
- **Growth mindset:** your abilities are something you can improve through practice

Video about the implications of fixed vs. growth mindset

Summary of video:

||Fixed mindset|Growth mindset|
|-|-|-|
|*Abilities*|Innate and unchangeable|Can improve through practice|
|*Failure*|Permanent|Chance to learn|
|*Critical feedback*|Personal attack|Chance to improve|
|*Task choice*|Easier|Challenging|
|*Effort*|Minimal|Work hard to improve|
|*Obstacle*|Likely to give up|Chance to experiment and solve problems|
|*Focus on*|Measurable accomplishments|Journey of continual improvement|
|*Creative risks*|Less likely to take|Way to innovate and improve|

**The growth mindset is important for both instructors and learners.**
- Instructors can become better teachers (teaching is a skill)
- Learners can become better coders
- Instructors can promote a growth mindset in learners

### How can we promote a growth mindset in learners?

Different types of praise:

- **Performance-based praise:** usually supports 'intrinsic' model of competence, implies outcome is most important part of task
  - Example: You're so smart!
  - Promotes fixed mindset
- **Effort-based praise:** focuses on learner's hard work
  - Example: Good job - you must have worked very hard!
  - Promotes growth mindset
- **Improvement-based praise:** draws learner's attention to progress they've made
  - Example: Nice job - you've made a lot of progress on that problem!
  - Promotes growth mindset

#### Exercise
What types of praise are the following, and which ones promote a growth mindset?
- I like the way you tried a couple of different strategies to solve that problem.
- You’re getting really good at that. Keep up the hard work!
- You’re really talented.
- That was a hard problem. You didn’t get the right answer, but look at how much you learned trying to solve it!

## Let's watch someone live code

Example 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXxBeNkKmJE&feature=youtu.be
Example 2:

For each video, think about 4 pieces of feedback:

||Content|Presentation|
|-|-|-|
|**Good**|||
|**Bad**|||

## Tips on how to live code

_"If someone feels it’s too slow, they’ll be a bit bored. If they feel it’s too fast, they’ll never come back to programming."_ — Kunal Marwaha, SWC instructor

### Basics
- Instructors should:
  1. Explain what they're going to do
  1. Say what they are typing as they type it
  1. Explain what they did again afterwards
- Go slowly - learners will probably type slower than you and also have to follow your thought process
- Use formative assessments to make sure people are actually understanding the material. For us, this is our 'Practice' session.
- Limit number of concepts introduced in a lesson - only a few things can be stored in short-term memory at a time (~7+/-2) - reinforce them _a lot_
- Stick to the lesson material
- Use sticky notes, see below, to gauge learners’ progress and understanding
- If you want, use illustrations to help learners understand and organize the material
- Emphasize that you want questions

### Coding
- Avoid using keyboard shortcuts
- Don't copy-paste code - need to reinforce concepts
- Always let the learner type (don't type for them) - they need to learn how to do it on their own, and they'll feel more accomplished when they get it
- Use a big font, and maximize the window. Black font on white background is good. Draw up the bottom of window(s) to make sure all learners can see code
- Try to create an environment that is as similar as possible to what your learners have to reduce cognitive load


### Wording
- Try not to use too much vocabulary. We may call the same thing by different names, but learners might get confused about this. Ex. folder, directory, repository.
- Don't say things like 'oh, it's easy, you just...' - seems like the learner's problem is trivial and they must be stupid not to understand it
- Acknowledge when learners are confused - acknowledge validity, encourages growth mindset
- Ask 'What questions do people have?' rather than 'Does anyone have any questions?' - shows you expect people to have questions. (I usually say 'Questions?')
- Effort-based & improvement-based praise (not performance-based; see above)
- Don't act surprised about learners not knowing something - ex. "I can't believe you don't know/haven't heard of X" - signals that they don't belong/may prevent them from asking questions

### Making mistakes
- It's okay to make mistakes! It's helpful for learners to see how you troubleshoot
- Admit you don't know things - shows that even you have things to learn
- Share stories about mistakes you've made or things you struggled to learn - reassures learners that it's okay to find topics difficult
- Errors are essential to learning
  - Barrier to learning is avoidance of making errors - fearful of making them because associated with negative emotions
  - Positive error framing - present errors as integral part of learning process and use as teaching opportunities

### Managing different skill levels
  - Ask more advanced learners to help people next to them
  - Don't let enthusiastic advanced learners carry the conversation (reserve for breaks or facilitators)
  - Facilitators should keep an eye on learners who are falling behind and intervene early
  - Find a balance between too slow and too fast that works for the majority of the group
    - Don't dive into complex/detailed technical discussions with a subset of the room

### Attitude
- Be enthusiastic - learners respond to instructor's enthusiasm
- Don't be negative about things - Excel, Word, Windows, GUIs, other tools
- Promote perseverance
- When did you feel demotivated? Try not to do this when you're teaching :)
- Be relatable & give relatable examples
- Be yourself and have fun!

### Logistics
- Turn off notifications on your laptop and phone
- Make sure lighting is good (not too dark, no light shining on screen)

### Stickies

We use pink and green sticky notes to help us teach. Learners put up a pink sticky when they have a question, and a facilitator/helper can go to them and help them out. Green stickies mean all is good. You can use them to see if learners have finished a problem. This allows learners to be more discrete and keep working while they wait for a facilitator to come help. It also allows instructors to gauge how well the learners are following along.
