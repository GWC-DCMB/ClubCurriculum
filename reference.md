* How to find the number of rows, columns, and number of data points in a `DataFrame`.

### Lesson12_Pandas-Subsetting

* How to use square brackets to subset columns.
* How to use `iloc` to subset rows.
* How to use `iloc` and square brackets at the same time.
* How to use `query` to find rows where the column has a certain value.

### Lesson17_Matplotlib_Intro

* Using **matplotlib** package of Python to communicate your data using **line graph** plots.
* Adding labels and a title to a plot
* Adding markers to a line graph
* Changing the color of a line graph

### Lesson18_LineGraph_ScatterPlot

* Improve a line graph plot by overlaying multiple lines
