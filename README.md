# Club Curriculum

This repository contains the curriculum materials for our weekly club.

The Lessons directory contains live coding demos meant to introduce each topic in ~15 minute interactive mini-lessons. These lessons are delivered in Jupyter Notebooks in a "fill in the blanks" style. Instructors will guide students through each lesson and the students will follow along, filling in the blanks on their own documents as we go.

The Practices directory contains practice exercises for students to spend ~30 minutes to solidify skills taught in each mini-lesson. These practices are delivered in Jupyter Notebooks in a "fill in the blanks" style. Students will work with partners/groups to fill in blanks within the documents, using code from the corresponding lesson as a resource. Instructors will work closely with students to help them complete and understand each practice.

Both Lessons and Practices directories contain `_Keys` subdirectories with correctly completed versions of each exercise. Sometimes GitHub doesn't render Jupyter notebooks in a timely manner, so we use continuous integration to compile all notebook keys to PDFs. Take a look at the [Lesson](Lessons/_Keys/pdf) & [Practice](Lessons/_Keys/pdf) Key PDFs if you only want to view them quickly in your browser.
