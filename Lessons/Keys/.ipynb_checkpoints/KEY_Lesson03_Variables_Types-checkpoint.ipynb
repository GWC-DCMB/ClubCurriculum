These basic kinds of data come in pre-defined flavors, called **types**. Each type has certain key ways to identify it and certain rules that it has to follow. All variables fall into some type, and you can use the `type` function to determine the type of any variable. Let's test this with our `apples` variable from above."

Strings are defined using single quotations `' '` or double quotations `\" \"`, as long as they match at the start and end of the string. This is what separates strings from varaible or function names and tells Python to view it as a string value. Remember that everything in programming is extremely literal, so we have to be very explicit about what we mean when writing code. \n",
