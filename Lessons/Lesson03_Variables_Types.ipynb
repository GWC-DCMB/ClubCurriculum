Often we need to work with text data, which are called **strings** in Python and designated using `str`.

Strings are defined using single quotations `' '` or double quotations `\" \"`, as long as they match at the start and end of the string. This is what separates strings from varaible or function names and tells Python to view it as a string value. Remember that everything in programming is extremely literal, so we have to be very explicit about what we mean when writing code. \n",
