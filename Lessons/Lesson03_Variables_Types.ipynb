Each variable is assigned a value, and then we can use the variable name to reference the value it represents. \n","\n","Variables are very helpful in coding. Not only do they prevent us from having to remember and type the values over and over again, it allows us to update certain values when we have new information. For example, let's say we have a variable `apples` that stores the number of apples we have in our refrigerator.

This is called **incrementing**. \n","\n","Let's say I had some friends coming over for dinner and I wanted to make an apple pie for dessert. This used up 4 apples.

In fact, Python allows us to store several different kinds of data and assign their values to variables. These basic kinds of data come in pre-defined flavors, called **types**. Each type has certain key ways to identify it and certain rules that it has to follow. All variables fall into some type, and you can use the `type()` function to determine the type of any variable.

Often we need to work with text data, which are called **strings** in Python and designated using `str`. Strings are comprised of characters, like letters or symbols, or a bunch of characters put together, like words. Strings are defined using single quotations `' '` or double quotations `\" \"`, as long as they match at the start and end of the string. This is what separates strings from varaible or function names and tells Python to view it as a string value. Remember that everything in programming is extremely literal, so we have to be very explicit about what we mean when writing code. \n","\n","We used a string in our very first line of code from the last lesson - can anyone remember what it was?"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"rzcIhVVZ9LmR","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# create string variable name, print type\n","\n"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SIR0K56G9LmV","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Like the numeric types, strings have to follow some basic rules for how they can behave in Python.
