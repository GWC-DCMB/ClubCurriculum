We previously used a small dataset that was hard-coded right in the notebook. But in the real world, we want to be able to use large datasets that can't be easily hard-coded or typed out by hand. We store large datasets as files in the CSV format, which allows different programs like Excel, Google Sheets, or our Python programs to share data easily. \n","\n","We have some data stored in Google Drive, so first we need to access it:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"ehXY45RAt1DU","colab":{}},"source":["# mount Google Drive\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/gdrive')\n","path = '/content/gdrive/My Drive/SummerExperience-master/'"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"ZgNq_eJkt5SX"},"source":["When you run the above cell, it will prompt you to follow a link.
