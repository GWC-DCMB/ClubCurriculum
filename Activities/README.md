- Zip-Zap-Zop
    1.  Zip-Zap-Zop (ZZZ): Everyone stands in a circle. The goal is to pass the "energy" around the circle. Someone starts and they pass the "energy" to any other person in the circle by simultaneously saying "zip" while making eye contact and "passing a clap." To pass the clap, you have one arm out, bent, like you're about to give a handshake, and the other hand does a "drive-by": starting at the chest, extending to make the clap, and ending by pointing straight out toward the other person. Then the new person with the energy passes to someone else the same way (eye contact, pass the clap), but this time they say "zap" instead of "zip". Then the next person does the same but with "zop." Then you just keep going repeating those three words, always in that order, as needed. It's important to be ready at any time because you never know when it's going to come to you. It's also important to make eye contact and make a clear point so the person knows when they have been passed to. The game should fall into a rhythm. Try to eliminate pauses. There should be some excitement in passing the energy. There may be a bunch of mistakes at first if people aren't focused, and people generally get better with practice.
    1. ZZZ with Names: To learn each otherâ€™s names, do all the same actions, but rather than using "zip-zap-zop" first do a round where they just say their own name when passing the energy. Then do a round where they say the name of the person they are passing to. Then do a round where they say the name of the person that passed the energy to them (the first person has to make something up).
    1. ZZZ expert name: You make eye contact and pass the clap, but say a random name. The energy passes to the person whose name was said, not to who was pointed to.
- Improv story
    - Stand in a circle and say one word at a time to create a story around the circle. You can pick some topics for the story by having group members answer questions like what sport did you play as a child, what story did you like as a child, where is a place you want to go, what is an object you can hold in your hand. Try to use proper nouns like names instead of he/she when possible.
- Pitch an app
    - Think about an app that would be beneficial to your community or the world. How would you convince someone that your app is important and significant? A pitch! That doesn't mean you're going to throw it across the room like a baseball player! A pitch is a short story that people can tell about something they've created to get listeners excited and make them want to learn more. Pitches can take many different forms. They can be something you say to another person, a formal presentation, an email, or even a video. Make a pitch about your app!
- Stand-ups
    - What did you accomplish this meeting? Give an example of how you were brave, resilient, creative, or purposeful.  Do you need help with anything next meeting? Shout out a Clubmate for something they accomplished.
- Write thank-you cards to our sponsors.
- Salad bowl
    - Write down nouns on pieces of paper. Fold them in half and put them in a bowl.
    - Split into 2 teams. 
    - There are 3 rounds to this game, all with the same team. Each round consists of sub-rounds of 1 minute. Team 1 will go for one minute, then Team 2 will go for one minute, etc. A different person is a clue -iver for each sub-round (until everyone has had a turn, then you start over again). The goal of each 1 minute sub-round is for the clue giver to try to get their team to guess as many words as possible. They pick out one word at a time. Each round lasts until all of the words have been guessed. There are different clues the clue-giver can give each round:
        - _Round 1: Verbal Cues._ The clue-giver picks a word from the bowl and describes it to their teammates without saying the actual word. Once the word is correctly guessed, they can select another word from the bowl. This continues until 1 minute is up. If the last word isn't guessed, it's placed back in the bowl.
        - _Round 2: Charades._ Similar, the clue-giver has to act the word out with no talking.
        - _Round 3: One Word._ Similar, but the clue-giver can only say 1 word.
  - Points: 1 point for each word guessed correctly. Add up all points for all rounds. The team with the most points wins.
